## About
I'm a highly motivated student at UT Austin pursuing a double major in Economics and Mathematics. I combine quantitative rigor with product intuition, having applied my skills across internships in data analysis, financial modeling, and investment strategy.

I earned an **IBM Product Management Certification** which strengthened my product discovery, roadmap creation, and agile tooling skills (Jira, Miro). I enjoy translating customer pain points into prioritized product solutions.

**Core Philosophy:** *Use data to ask the right questions, and empathy to build the right answers.*
