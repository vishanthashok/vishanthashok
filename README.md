I am a highly analytical and driven Economics & Mathematics student at The University of Texas at Austin with a demonstrated history in data analysis, financial modeling, and investment strategy. My recent IBM Product Management Certification has solidified my passion for building user-centric products and bridging the gap between technical development and business goals.

I am actively seeking Product Management internship roles where I can apply my quantitative background and newly acquired product strategy skills to create meaningful impact.
