**Strategy • Investing • Market Analysis**

## Overview

I am an economics undergraduate at **The University of Texas at Austin** with a strong focus on **strategy, private markets, and analytical decision-making**. My work sits at the intersection of **investment research, corporate strategy, and data-driven analysis**, with experience across private equity, investment banking, hedge funds, and real asset investing.

This GitHub serves as a **strategy notebook** — a place to document frameworks, analyses, experiments, and long-form thinking around markets, businesses, and capital allocation.
